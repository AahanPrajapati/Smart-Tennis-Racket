## Connections

### ESP32 to MPU6050
| ESP32 Pin  | MPU6050 Pin | Function          |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 3V3        | VCC (Pin 6) | Power Supply      |
| GND        | GND (Pin 5) | Ground            |
| IO21       | SDA (Pin 4) | I2C Data          |
| IO22       | SCL (Pin 3) | I2C Clock         |

### ESP32 to LED Strip (WS2812)
| ESP32 Pin  | LED Strip Pin | Function          |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| IO23       | DIN           | Data Input        |
| GND        | GND           | Ground            |
| 5V (BAT1)  | VCC           | Power Supply (+5V)|

### Capacitor
- Connect **1000uF** capacitor **across** the **+5V** and **GND** lines of the **LED strip**.
- This helps stabilize voltage and protect the strip from sudden current changes.

## Step-by-Step Assembly

### 1. **Power the ESP32**
- Connect the **5V battery pack** to the **5V** pin on the ESP32 and **GND**.
- Verify your battery provides a stable **5V** output.

### 2. **Connect MPU6050 to ESP32**
- Use jumper wires to connect **VCC, GND, SDA, and SCL**.
- Ensure your connections are secure; loose connections can cause communication issues.

### 3. **Wire the LED Strip**
- Connect the **DIN** pin of the LED strip to **IO23** on the ESP32.
- Provide **5V power** from the battery to the **VCC** of the LED strip.
- Ground the LED strip to the ESP32 **GND**.

### 4. **Add Capacitor**
- Solder or connect the **1000uF capacitor** between **+5V** and **GND** as close to the LED strip as possible.

### 5. **Check All Connections**
- Double-check polarity (especially for power connections).
- Ensure I2C lines (SDA/SCL) are not swapped.

## Power Supply Details

- **ESP32** runs on **5V** (provided by BAT1 in the schematic).
- **MPU6050** gets **3.3V** from the ESP32.
- **LED strip** needs a stable **5V** with enough current (calculate your LED current draw).
- If your LED strip draws high current, consider adding a separate power source for it, sharing the **common ground** with ESP32.

## Best Practices

- **Solder connections** for a permanent, reliable setup.
- Add **heat shrink tubing** around joints for protection.
- Use **Velcro straps** or **cable ties** to mount components securely on the racket.
- Isolate the electronics from vibrations and shocks during gameplay
